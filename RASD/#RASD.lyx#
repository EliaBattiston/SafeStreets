\begin_layout Section
Product perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product, built from scratch, will use the geolocation systems embedded
 in the smartphones to acquire data about the position of the violation
 and the smartphone camera for plate and violation pictures.
 It won't be possible to manually load photos and position to avoid fake
 reports.
 All connections will be handled via HTTPS requests with TLS encryption,
 to ensure that reports arrive from the sender to the central system with
 no external manipulation and no external access by non-authorized personnel;
 this also grants GDPR accompliance.
 Data will be saved in an external-hosted database as long as the central
 server for data elaboration; privacy will be granted by the maintainer
 of the servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systems dialogates with the municipality services via custom API designed
 for SafeStreet for acquiring informations about occured incidents (with
 the aim of crossing informations and analyze potentially unsafe or dangerous
 areas to be noticed to the municipality) and sending report informations
 to the automatic checking system of the municipality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Product functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explicit all the possibilities that will and won't be offered by the
 system, in the following paragraphs all the available functions are listed
 and punctually analyzed.
 The aim of the explanation is to line up an unambiguous description of
 what the system is expected to do and what users can or can't do, in addition
 to covering the goals listed here.

\begin_layout Subsection
Violation reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users who notice a violation are granted to notice it to authorities using
 SafeStreets app, via the compilation of a small form inside the app and
 attaching to it pictures of the violation and of the plate number; data
 about time and position will be automatically taken from local time (acquired
 via the Internet connection) and the built-in GPS of the smartphone.
 As already said in the Product perspective and fully explained in the Hardware
 constraints section, devices which are not equipped with a camera, GPS
 sensor or a functioning Internet connection won't be able to notify violations,
 due to the necessity to grant the correctness of the informations and the
 effective presence of a real violation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Registered violations will be notified to authorities, who then proceed
 to check offenders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data visualization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systems allow registered users to access to analyzed and anonimyzed
 data about the distribution of the reports over the selected area, presented
 in form of a map with highlighted areas in graded colors, from less-reported
 areas to highly-reported areas (from green to red); users ha ve the possibility
 to zoom in and out in the map, having as upper limit the city in the whole
 and lower limit of detail a single street (it won't be possible to visualize
 details about the distribution of reports along a single street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to registered users, officers will have the possibility to visualize
 the distribution of the reports with no lower bound, in addition to the
 visualitazion of the full list of reports without anonimizations and the
 list of the most reported cars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data analysis and notification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central SafeStreet system acquires data from the municipality via the
 granted APIs to be crossed with the data from the reports; the result will
 be then automatically analyzed from the system itself to verify possible
 unsafe or even dangerous areas of the city (the level of dangerousness
 is directly connected to the category of violation of each report and the
 quantity of reports arriving from that area).
 The system will grant authorities access to the elaborated data and possible
 correcting maneuvers, such as the positioning of barriers to separate the
 vehicle part of the road from the pedestrian one, with .
