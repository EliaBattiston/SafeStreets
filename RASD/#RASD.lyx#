Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This RASD is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document of the
 project SafeStreets.
 Objectives of this document are to fully analyze and describe the customer
 prospective, represent the system in terms of its requirements, describe
 the solution adopted in terms of its use cases and show the constraints
 and the limit of this community tool.
 The addressees of this document are developers working on the implmentation
 of the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Description of the given problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SafeStreets is a community service that aims to provide the users of the
 possibility to notify parking and traffic violations.
 It can be done providing proofs of the accident like pictures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal is to raise awareness in drivers that driving and parking can make
 other's life harder.
 With a little effort instead, they can makes it easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The service’ll be served through a mobile application where users can post
 new violations and see the ones shared by others.
 A shared picture comes with the metadata provided by the smartphone (like:
 time, place, meteorological conditions...) and with valuable information given
 by the user whom can describe the accident and attach any kind of usefull
 information he can.
 More pictures of the same accident will be connected crossing the spacial
 and time information so that more viewing angles will be available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure the chain of custody, the backend infrastructure will run an AI
 algorithm to ensure the quality of the data given (eg.
 no edited picture) before posting them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Authorities has access to all the data provide by the users, plus: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
API to cross their informations with SafeStreet ones.
 Thanks to AI algorithms, they’ll get suggestions from the system on ways
 the municipality can improve the safety of the streets, data accessible
 directly from their dashboard;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
API for generating automatic traffic tikets from the data collected;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maps of the less safe roads in the city;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Veicles that comit the most violations (use eg.: the municipality can cross
 this data with the list of new entered veichles in the city or check a
 veichle if it’s often in violation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Get statistics for their municipality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Current systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There’s no automatic system for sharing violations as SafeStreets.
 A citizen has to take call the autorities if it sees one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead there are already multiple municipality systems that we can integrate,
 for the automatic tickets or the municipality information retrivial.
 We opted to open the municipality to our API so they can choose to interact
 with the data and services we provide.
